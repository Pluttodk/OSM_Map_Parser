# OSM Map Parser
A larger project made in Java. The project was based around creating a live map of Denmark with the assistanse of a KD_Tree

The project was made so that it would take a OSM file (taken from Open Street Map). In order for the map to functionate proberly it was made sure that it could be zoomed in at multiple spots to better view the smaller roads. All this was made with the help of a KD Tree.

Additionally a route could be planned from point A to point B. This was made by use of Dijkstra with A*. The pathfinder made use of a address parser. Additionally all the logo's used are Open Source and was taken from Iconfinder.com.

It has been coded according to the MVC principle. The UI was coded with Java Swing

To Run the code. Make sure that the newest Java Compiler is installed. Additionally make use of the package Algs4.
If you wanna try with a different OSM file. Simply use the option to load your own.
